#Robust Estimation
Extracts simple image models from noisy image measurements. Example being used is cell detection.

This program will achieve the following:

1. Propose candidates for cell detection
2. Select least-squares fit candidate to minimize error
3. Robust fit the cell

Run findCellScript.m file to see results.
