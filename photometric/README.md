#Photometric Stereo
Constructs a depth field from a series of images of an object from the
same view point under different illumination conditions.

This program will do the following:

1. Recover light source directions
2. Estimate surface normals at each pixels
3. Estimate albedo of the object at each pixel
4. Estimate the depth at each pixel
